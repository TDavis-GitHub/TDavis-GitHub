- 👋 Hi, I’m @TDavis-GitHub
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about how to write SQL Quereys, Stored Procedures, and Funcations, to be used for pulling data for reporting purposes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SLQ and Power Query, and refreshing my Bash knowledge from 15+ years ago when I ran RedHat Linux as my Destkop (Currenlty Running MAC OS)
- 💞️ I’m looking to find examples of how other people have solved similar problems, and expnad my own knowledge in how to extract data for reporting and analysis, and brush up on old skills I have let fall away.
- 📫 I can be reached here on GitHub.....mayube more places later
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I recenlty picked up wood working as a hobby, and having fun making a bunch of mistakes while honing a new set of skills.
